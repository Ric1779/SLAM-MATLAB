# Monocular ORB-SLAM

## Overview

This repository showcases a project in which I successfully executed 6 Degrees of Freedom (6 DoF) camera pose estimation and 3D scene reconstruction using the TUM RGBD dataset. The process involved ORB feature matching, fundamental matrix computation, and 3D map initialization. During the tracking phase, I employed the PnP algorithm for pose estimation, refined results through bundle adjustment, and implemented Bags-of-Words for loop closure.
